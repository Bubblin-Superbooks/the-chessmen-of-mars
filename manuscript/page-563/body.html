By writing the names and moves of the various pieces on bits of paper and pasting them on ordinary checkermen the game may be played quite as well as with the ornate pieces used upon Mars.</p><p>THE BOARD: Square board consisting of one hundred alternate black and orange squares.</p><p>THE PIECES: In order, as they stand upon the board in the first row, from left to right of each player.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Warrior: 2 feathers; 2 spaces straight in any direction</p></div> </div>
