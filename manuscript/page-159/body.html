<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Gloomy were the thoughts that filled the mind of Tara of Helium as she awaited the summons from Luudâ€”the summons that could mean for her but one thing; death. She guessed why he had sent for her and she knew that she must find the means for self-destruction before the night was over; but still she clung to hope and to life. She would not give up until there was no other way. She startled Ghek once by exclaiming aloud, almost fiercely: "I still live!"</p><p>"What do you mean?" asked the kaldane.</p><p>"I mean just what I say," she replied. "I still live and while I live I may still find a way. Dead, there is no hope."</p><p>"Find a way to what?" he asked.</p><p>"To life and liberty and mine own people," she responded.</p><p>"None who enters Bantoom ever leaves," he droned.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">She did not reply and after a time he spoke again.</p></div> </div>
