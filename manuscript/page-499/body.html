<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">you search for Tara through the spiral runway where we nearly met?"</p><p>"Tasor told me where you were to be found, and as I have explored the greater part of the palace by means of the ulsio runways and the darker and less frequented passages I knew precisely where you were and how to reach you. This secret spiral ascends from the pits to the roof of the loftiest of the palace towers. It has secret openings at every level; but there is no living Manatorian, I believe, who knows of its existence. At least never have I met one within it and I have used it many times. Thrice have I been in the chamber where O-Mai lies, though I knew nothing of his identity or the story of his death until Tasor told it to us in the camp of U-Thor."</p><p>"You know the palace thoroughly then?" Gahan interrupted.</p><p>"Better than O-Tar himself or any of his servants."</p></div> </div>
