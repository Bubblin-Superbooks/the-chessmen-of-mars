There are many minds working against mine and presently mine will tire and O-Tar will be himself again. You must make the best of your opportunity while you may.

Follow one that runs due west and it will bring you to The Gate of Enemies. The rest will then lie with you. I can do no more; hurry before my waning powers fail meâ€”I am not as Luud, who was a king. He could have held this creature forever. Make haste! Go!"</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
